## 📂 Purpose

**📜 Summary:**\
Create a **maze generator** that takes a configuration file, generates a maze and writes it to a file using a hexadecimal wall representation. The maze will also have a visual representation either in ASCII, or by using the minilibx.

**📮 Makefile:**\
This project must include a Makefile with strict following rules:
- `install`: Install all project dependencies using **pip**, **uv**, **pipx**, or any other package manager.
- `run`: Execute the main script of the project.
- `debug`: Run the main script in debug mode using Python`s built-in-debugger.
- `clean`: Remove all temporary files or caches.
- `lint`: Execute **flake8** (norme checker) and **mypy** (hint checker)
- `lint-strict`: Same as above but with **--strict**.

**🐍 Challenge:**
- Avoid any crashes.
- Prevent any leaks.
- Include type hint *(def func (name:str) -> bool)*. Use **Mypy** to check any potential error `pip install mypy`, then `mypy script.py`
- Include docstrings following **PEP 257** for better understanding.

**🏆 Goal:**
